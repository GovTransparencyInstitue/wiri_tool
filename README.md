What is WIRI?

The Water Integrity Risk Index (WIRI) is a tool for measuring integrity in the water and sanitation sector at the city level. It allows you to assess smaller changes in integrity across cities within a country and over time.

WIRI produces a score between 0 and 100. Cities with scores closer to 100 have lower risks of corruption.

How to use this tool?

To use this tool, you will need to upload some data sets: procurement (mandatory), survey (optional) and keywords (optional). These data sets must be constructed in the format detailed in the WIRI tool manual (see tab above). We provide some example data sets based on procurement and survey data for Peru.
