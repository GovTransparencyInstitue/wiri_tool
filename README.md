## What is this tool?

This app allows users to measure integrity in the water and sanitation sector using data on public procurement as well as surveys. It calculates a complex indicator which allows users to measure corruption in the sector over time and at the city level. Users can upload their own data sets or use one of the data sets (csv files) provided as an example. After uploading the files correctly in the control panel (first tab), users can see the results as tables and graphs in the dashboard (second tab). We provide a video tutorial and an extensive manual to help guide users in uploading the example data sets and creating their own from publicly available sources. We hope that this tool will help different actors better monitor and combat corruption in a crucial sector for human well-being.

## What is WIRI?

The Water Integrity Risk Index (WIRI) is a tool for measuring integrity in the water and sanitation sector at the city level. It allows you to assess smaller changes in integrity across cities within a country and over time.

WIRI produces a score between 0 and 100. Cities with scores closer to 100 have lower risks of corruption.

## How to use this tool?

To use this tool, you will need to upload some data sets: procurement (mandatory), survey (optional) and keywords (optional). These data sets must be constructed in the format detailed in the WIRI tool manual (see tab above). We provide some example data sets based on procurement and survey data for Peru.

Once you have the required data set(s), please follow these steps:

1. Select no survey OR upload survey data (CSV) when available
2. Upload procurement data (CSV)
3. Select keywords language (Spanish, English) OR upload your own custom keywords (CSV)
4. Click submit
5. The section diagnostics will inform you if the calculations were successfull
6. Go to the dashboard tab and view the results
7. In the dashboard, you can explore the composite WIRI score and its sub-components.
